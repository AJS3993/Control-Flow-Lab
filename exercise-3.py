# exercise-03 Calculate Dog Years

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter a dog's age in human years like this:
#      Input a dog's age in human years: 
# 2. Calculates the equivalent dog years, where:
#      - The first two years count as 10 years each
#      - Any remaining years count as 7 years each
# 3. Prints the answer in the following format:
#      The dog's age in dog years is xx

# Hint:  Use the int() function to convert the string returned from input() into an integer

age = input('Input a dogs age in human years:')

if int(age) <= 2:
    years=int(age)*10
    print(years)
else:
    years = (int(age)-2)*7+20
    print(years)
